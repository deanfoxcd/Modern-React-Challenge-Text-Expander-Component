# Coding Challenge - Building a Text Expander Component

I built this without the solution at all and it was almost identical to the solution. The only difference was that I used a ternary operator to generate the whole button but the course solution only generated one button and used the ternary to render the show/hide text. Probably more eofficient but it is minimal, I'm not gonna change mine
